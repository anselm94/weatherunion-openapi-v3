# Weather Union - OpenAPI 3.0 Documentation

[Weather Union](https://www.weatherunion.com/) is a free weather API operated by [Zomato](https://zomato.com), gathering weather data from community-operated weather stations. This data is provided via API for free under fair use.

While the Weather Union dashboard offers documentation, no structured OpenAPI 3.0 documentation existed for structured access for example, to help AI agents better understand the API to make use of this Weather API. This repository addresses that gap, with documentation created using Gemini 2.5 Pro and hosted on GitHub. Please note that the API is the work of Weather Union/Zomato.
